# Overview

DC-CLI is a command line wizard designed to smoothly download and deploy DAO.Casino SDK elements. The idea behind it is to reduce the number of similar manual operations (e.g. changing the same value at several points) and, subsequently, to reduce the risk of errors.

# Prerequisites:
To use dc-cli, you need:
* one of the recent [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) versions (10 or newer)
* Bash Terminal (if you are using Windows, see here for more details https://github.com/DaoCasino/Documentation/blob/master/2.%20Developer%20Sandbox/2.1.%20Development%20Stack.md)

A developer is expected to be familiar with Solidity to edit the game smart contract.

Note that the whole solution has been successfully tested on .nix OS's and Mac OS. It is supposed to be compatible with Windows, but no tests have been carried out so far. You may need to install additional applications.

# Installation
To install DC-CLI, call:

```
 npm i -g dc-cli
```
